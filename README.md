### Learning Ray Tracing

This repo marks my progress of Ray Tracing learning. The main source material can be found here: <in1weekend.com>. I highly recommend it, go check!

Most code may be identical to those in the book if the sample code is provided there. However, I go through each line and make adjustments, make it more C++ -like rather than C/C++ mixture, change some implementation so structures are more clear and classes/methods are more robust, add a lot of "cout"s for monitoring and testing purposes, and some play-around.
